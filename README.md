# Challenge-1-CSS-

## Description

For this week's challenge, we were to debug and improve upon a provided HTML starter code.  Given that not all of the links were functional, the objective was to anaylze the code and stylesheet and identify the bugs.  Once completed, the second objective was to ensure that the CSS was semantically correct.  There are loads of div tags in the pre-existing code that do not properly identify the sections to a third party coder, making it less easy to interpret the final product.  The solution was to quickly clean up the code by replacing the div tags with more descriptive identifiers.

This challenge was very useful in helping to build an understanding of why semantics are important, especially when working with a team.  It cleans up the code and helps each user to more easily navigate through independent sections and potentially speed up the debugging process.
